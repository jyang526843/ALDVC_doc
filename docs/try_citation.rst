An easy way is just to use the final link of the page/section.
This works, but it has :ref:`some disadvantages <target to paragraph>`:


.. _target to image1:

.. figure:: /img/logo.png
   :alt: Logo
   :align: center
   :width: 240px

   Link me image1!

.. _target to image2:

.. figure:: /img/logo2.png
   :alt: Logo
   :align: center
   :width: 240px

   Link me image2


:numref:`target to image1`



:numref:`target to image2`



.. _target to table:

.. figure:: /img/logo.png
   :alt: Logo
   :align: center
   :width: 240px

   Link me table!
